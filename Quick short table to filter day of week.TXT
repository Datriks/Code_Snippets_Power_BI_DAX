Instead of using the Date table to select the day of
the week, we can store the day of the week in a separate table
that filters Sales without being related to Date. This way, the
automatic filter removal over Date does not affect the existing filter
over the day of the week. For example, the Day of Week table can
be created as a calculated table:


Day_Of_Week = SELECTCOLUMNS(Dates,
		"Date",Dates[Date],
		"Day_Of_Week",Dates[Day of Week])

Slicing by Day of Week in the newly created table is compatible
with any time intelligence calculation and respects any filter on the
Day of Week table; this is because the two filters (Date and Day of
the week) belong to two different tables.
The additional table could consolidate any set of attributes
required by specific business rules. We built an example with the
day of the week, but you can use any other set of attributes (like
working days, holidays, seasons), provided that such attributes
depend on Order Date.
